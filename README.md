# re-fedora
install script with lesser know function inside of it. After a lot of research found the official methods for using functionality like using proxies with tools like, dnf ,flatpkas or DE's like plasma or gnome ... (all through the cli).

I have wrote a lot of notes on my local copy of the project with private information so I could not just push it to github. Now I will be cleaning it up and committing it properly and pushing it here.

note: most of this code has mostly been tested on fedora kde however, it has also done some tests on workstation, kinoite and silverblue. However, I did modify the script for the Immutable (Atomic) variants of fedora.
